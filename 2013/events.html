		<h3>OPEN SOURCE SCIENCE FAIR 2.0</h3>
		<h2><strong>July 25, 2013 [7-10:30pm]</strong></h2>
		<p>Every year, the TimesOpen series brings together the NYC developer community for technical talks on various topics. We've enjoyed great speakers, insightful discussions and a lot of live coding. Last year we tryied something new: an <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/open-source-science-fair-highlights/" target="_blank">open source science fair and symposium.</a></p>

		<p>Contributors to the open source community showed off their projects and we heard from three great speakers. We had so much fun&#8212;we decided to do it again. This year we'll have even more representatives from amazing open source projects around the web, and our keynote speakers will talk about the true meaning of open source. No science fair is complete without awards, so we'll end the night with some ribbons and prizes!</p>
